# binscreen
This simple program - for OpenComputers, and designed to be run from rc - displays text, from Pastebin or any other raw text source, on an OpenComputers monitor.

To use, simply put binscreen.lua into /etc/rc.d/ and enable it inside /etc/rc.cfg on your OpenComputers system. The URL of your feed is taken as a parameter. Please note that if your screen isn't square you'll need to edit the resolution inside the file. It is assumed that you're running OpenOS.
